From these attributes we could try to find the following information:
	- Most popular
		- The places where terrorist attacks happen most often (country, city, etc.)
		- Most popular goal of the attack
		- Most popular type of the attack
		- The correlation between the goal and the type of the attack
		- General description of targets (position, nationality...) - most popular
		- Information about the groups that have carried out the attacks
	- Visualisation
		- goal
		- type
		- places 
		- targets
	- number of attacks every year, visualise, and show a trend
	- number of casualties every year, visualise, and show a trend
	- hostages (number, ransom asked, ransom paid, length of kiddnapping, outcome)
	- us citizens
	- are attacks international or not, visualise
	- [possible, if it makes sense] clasters of geographical locations where attacks happened, the conclusion would be where most attacks occur
	- diferentiate between lethal and nonlethal attacks and show them visually
	- types of attacks over time
	- time of year/week/day when most of the attacks happen
	- visualise targets, perhaps even targets over time
	- is there a correlation between success, suicide, and/or multiple incidents (any combination of two will do, whichever makes the most sense)
	
	-Find more specific goals (what is the most dangerous city to live in, how is the Syria war affecting people, what about the migration crisis, groups claiming responsibility, find their characteristics, can you predict them)
