From these attributes we could try to find the following information:
	
	# General goals

	## Most popular
		* The places where terrorist attacks happen most often (country, city, etc.)
		* Most popular goal of the attack
		* Most popular type of the attack
		* The correlation between the goal and the type of the attack
		* General description of targets (position, nationality...) - most popular
		* Information about the groups that have carried out the attacks

	## Other
		* number of attacks every year, visualise, and show a trend
		* number of casualties every year, visualise, and show a trend
		* hostages (number, ransom asked, ransom paid, length of kiddnapping, outcome)
		* us citizens
		* are attacks international or not, visualise
		* [possible, if it makes sense] clasters of geographical locations where attacks happened, the conclusion would be where most attacks occur
		* diferentiate between lethal and nonlethal attacks and show them visually
		* types of attacks over time
		* time of year/week/day when most of the attacks happen
		* visualise targets, perhaps even targets over time
		* is there a correlation between success, suicide, and/or multiple incidents (any combination of two will do, whichever makes the most sense)
	
	#Specific goals

	## Find more specific goals (what is the most dangerous city to live in, how is the Syria war affecting people, what about the migration crisis, groups claiming responsibility, find their characteristics, can you predict them)
		* What is the most dangerous city/country to live in
		* What is the most dangerous profession to be a part of
		* What is the weapon that is the most used, which is the one that has killed the most people, can we create a distribution of which weapon kills how many people (or at least a distribution of how many it's killed so far)
		* Is there a correlation between the location of the attack and the type/weapon of the attack
		* What are the groups that claim responsibility most often (are ISIS and Al-Qaida included)
		* What is the correlation between the number of attacks they've claimed and the number of members thay have
		* Correlation between the number of members and location and type of attacks
		* ISIS
			* A map of their attacks
			* Distribution of the number of attacks (do they grow over time, is the organisation expanding)
			* Have they started attacking Europe more lately (is it correlated to the migration crisis)
			* Did they cause the migration crisis (Did they attack a lot before and around the time it started)
			* Can we find a typical attack (weapon, target, locaion)
			* What are the chances that they'll claim responsibility if the attack had a certain weapon, target, location...

		* The difference between ISIS and Al-Qaida
			* Where they attack (Al-Qaida preffers the west)
			* What were their targets
			* The distribution of their attack weapons
			* Is there a correlation between the attacks [the times, can the places be grouped (did they both attack in Europe in the span of a few days)]
			* Typical attacks, is it the one or the other
