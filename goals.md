It is good to have a hypothesis before we start. For example: *The number of attacks every year is growing*.

From these attributes we could try to find the following information:
	
# General goals

## Most popular
- The places where terrorist attacks happen most often (country, city, etc.)
- Most popular goal of the attack
- Most popular type of the attack
- The correlation between the goal and the type of the attack
- General description of targets (position, nationality...) most popular
	
## Other
- Number of attacks every year, visualise, and show a trend
- Number of casualties every year, visualise, and show a trend
- Numbers of lethal and non-lethal attacks and show them visually
## Phase 2
- [possible, if it makes sense] Clusters of geographical locations where attacks happened, the conclusion would be where most attacks occur
- Is there a correlation between success, suicide, and/or multiple incidents (any combination of two will do, whichever makes the most sense)
- Draw a map of attacks in an important area (scatter plot)
- Find the probability that you will be attacked and killed in a cerrtain city (eg. Baghdad)
- By finding probabilities find the typical attacks
- Find the city in which you are most likely to be attacked and killed
- Draw a bars stacked graph for weapons and countries
- Check if ISIS is attacking Europe more 
- Make moving averages by 5 year periodes and show than (in respect to attack, ir group)
- Try to do some regression in order to determine unknown values

# Specific goals

Find more specific goals (what is the most dangerous city to live in, how is the Syria war affecting people, what about the migration crisis, groups claiming responsibility, find their characteristics, can you predict them)

- What is the most dangerous city/country to live in [what city has most attacks, what city has most casualties]
- What is the most dangerous profession to be a part of [what profession is attacked the most, what profession has the most victims]
- What is the weapon that is the most used, which is the one that has killed the most people, can we create a distribution of which weapon kills how many people (or at least a distribution of how many it's killed so far)
- Is there a correlation between the location of the attack and the type/weapon of the attack
- What are the groups that claim responsibility most often (are ISIS and Al-Qaida included)
- What is the correlation between the number of attacks they've claimed and the number of members they have [maybe clustering them would be a better option]
- Correlation between the number of members and location and type of attacks
- ISIS
	- A map of their attacks
	- Distribution of the number of attacks (do they grow over time, is the organisation expanding)
	- Have they started attacking Europe more lately (is it correlated to the migration crisis)
	- [optional]Did they cause the migration crisis (Did they attack a lot before and around the time it started)
	- Can we find a typical attack (weapon, target, location) [find what they use most often]
	- What are the chances that they'll claim responsibility if the attack had a certain weapon, target, location...[number of attacks they've claimed responsibility for / number of attacks that are typical]
- The difference between ISIS and Al-Qaida [maybe we can do this later]
	- Where they attack (Al-Qaida prefers the west)
	- What were their targets
	- The distribution of their attack weapons
	- Is there a correlation between the attacks [the times, can the places be grouped (did they both attack in Europe in the span of a few days)]
	- Typical attacks, is it the one or the other
