![Lethal vs nonlethal attacks](images/lethal.png)



All the mid-results and other interesting results that we have found:
	
### Dependence of an attack being a suicide and a success:
	
- P(Success|Suicide)= 0.8928945713686859
- P(Success|not Suicide)= 0.9319741317491332
- P(Success * Suicide)= 0.027173219707600848
- P(Suicide)*P(Success)= 0.02749936858568745

The success of the attack is independent of whether the attack was a suicide.

### The 9 most dangerous cities according to the number of attacks are:
	
	['Baghdad' '6237']
 	['Karachi' '2530']
 	['Lima' '2358']
 	['Belfast' '2102']
 	['Santiago' '1614']
 	['Mosul' '1553']
 	['San Salvador' '1547']
 	['Mogadishu' '1169']
 	['Istanbul' '999']]
	
### But, the 9 most dangerous cities according to the number of victims are:
	
	 ['Baghdad' '18638.800000000003']
	 ['Karachi' '3555.0']
	 ['New York City' '2815.0']
	 ['Mosul' '2743.2']
	 ['Mogadishu' '2485.33']
	 ['Tikrit' '2392.0']
	 ['Beirut' '1963.0']
	 ['Maiduguri' '1958.9999999999998']
	 ['Ramadi' '1853.67']]
	
We can clearly see that the most dangerous city is Baghdad with 6237 attacks and 18638 victims in total. It is interesting to note, however, that the number of attacks and victims alike, for which the city is unknown is bigger than the number of attacks and victims of any known city. It is also notable that there are cities that have been attacked more often, but with less victims, than cities that have been attacked less often but with more victims. For example Lima is not found in the top 10 cities by killings, but it is third in the number of attacks, whereas New York is not in the top 10 in the number of attacks, but is third in the number of victims. However, if we check the numbers, it turns out that Lima has 797 recorded victims, but at the same time it has 227 attacks where the number of victims was unknown. Following this, Santiago has 163 victims, but 264 attacks with unknown number of victims.

### The correlation between the number of members and the number of attacks of a group:
	The Pearson correlation coefficient between the number of attacks and the members of is: -0.0178216906069
	The Pearson correlation coefficient between the number of attacks and the killings of is: 0.965210133435
	The Pearson correlation coefficient between the number of killings and the members of is: -0.0131359157301

It is clear that the number of members does not have much influence neither on the number of attacks, nor on the number of killings. It is unsurprising that the number of attacks and the number of killings are strongly correlated.

### Analysis about ISIL attacks:
![Number of attacks by ISIL per year](images/ISILattacksPerYear.png)

We can conclude that the number of attacks increases.

![Weapons used by ISIL](images/ISILweapons.png)

From this image we can notice that most common weapon that ISIL uses is explosives/bombs/dynamite, which is used in more than a half of their attacks.

![ISIL's target](images/ISILtarget.png)

From this graph we can conclude that the probability the attack to happen in Iraq is very high because the records about this terrorist organization are saying that most of the attacks so far are registered in Iraq.

### Other popular terrorist organizations:
In addition, the graphs about few popular terrorist groups are given:
