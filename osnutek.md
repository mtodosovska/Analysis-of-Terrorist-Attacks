# Description of the data set

Our team chose **Global Terrorism** as a topic of this project. We are going to work with the *Global Terrorism Database* which can be found at the following link: [https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd](https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd)

The database consists of information about more than 150 000 terrorist attacks. Our goals and questions for which we hope to find answers during data analysis are: to try to predict future attacks, to find the country that is targeted the most in terrorist attacks, to try to find the similarities among attacks.

The database is given in ***CSV*** (comma-separated values) format, where each line of the file is a data record and information are separated by commas.
